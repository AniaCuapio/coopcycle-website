  en: '<p>Tricargo is a cooperative which develops, produces and runs cargo bikes. We are specializing in last mile delivery in the city centre of Hamburg. Our vision is to improve urban life by modern e-mobility and social working conditions. tricargo proves the enormous potential of bicycle based deliveries since 2016. The founding team and many employees know each other from bicycle events like the critical mass.</p><p>Tours with many stops are our specialty. We started with subscription boxes from local, organic farmers and keep on diversifying: catering for daycare-centres, mail service for local companies, reusable packaging for zero-waste shops and dollie shots.<br>In 2018 we unloaded the cargo sail ship Avontuur which sailed from Nicaragua to Hamburg with coffee, cocoa and rum: this pro bono event made our team really proud.</p>'
